# Deep-Hashing-Network-ADS

This is the ADS project 2 source code using tensorflow

We used [bvlc_reference_caffenet](http://dl.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/bvlc_reference_caffenet.caffemodel) as the pre-trained model

We developed Alexnet and add a new layer to make a deep hashing network

The idea is from "Deep Hashing Network for Efficient Similarity Retrieval" (AAAI 16) 

The origin source code is in [thuml-hash-caffe](https://github.com/thuml/hash-caffe)

*implementation of the AlexNet and DeepHashNet are in Architecture folder*
